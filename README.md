# m_reduction
The attached algorithm is implemented in MatLab and aims to construct a compact surrogate model from a set of inputs (X) and outputs (y). 

Two different model reduction techniques (a PLS-based method and Sure Independence Screening algorithm) run in parallel and return the best surrogate model, which is written in a txt file that can be used in the Software GAMS.
